# K Remix Helper

### Quality‑of‑life tools for the Legion Remix event

**K Remix Helper** is a lightweight addon that smooths out some of the rough edges of Legion Remix. It adds practical UI panels and tooltips, automates repetitive steps, and gives you quick access to the information you actually need while playing.

## ✨ Features

- **Auto Scrapper Panel**  
  Adds a side panel to the Scrapping Machine with a one‑click Fill All button. Options let you auto‑fill when the machine is empty and protect higher‑item‑level gear from being scrapped.

- **Smart Tooltips**  
  Player and unit tooltips show Threads totals, Infinite Power stat breakdowns, and Limits Unbound ranks. Group and objectives views are available directly from the minimap tooltip.

- **Minimap Icon & Tooltip**  
  A minimap button provides quick access to addon options. Hovering shows a detailed tooltip with Threads, currencies, stats, and shortcuts to group and objectives info.

- **Group and Objectives Views**  
  Integrated tooltip views display party/raid Threads data with sortable columns, and list active Infinite Research quests

- **Talent Alert Suppression**  
  Suppresses Blizzard’s “new talent available” alerts and tutorial popups, keeping your UI clear during Remix's accelerated leveling speed.
