## ✨ Features

- **Auto Scrapper Panel**  
  Adds a side panel to the Scrapping Machine with one‑click **Fill All** and options to auto‑fill or auto‑scrap. No more dragging items one by one.

- **Smart Tooltips**  
  See your total Threads and today’s gains right in player tooltips. Stat bonuses from Infinite Power are also broken down so you know exactly what you’re getting.

- **Bag Highlights**  
  Items with must‑have powers glow green, while disallowed ones glow red. A quick glance tells you what’s safe to equip and what to avoid.

- **Gear Guard**  
  Get an on‑screen warning if you accidentally equip a disallowed power or remove a required one. Protects you from costly mistakes.

- **Minimap Icon & Tooltip**  
  A clean minimap button with a detailed tooltip showing your Threads, currencies, and Infinite Power stats — all in one place.
